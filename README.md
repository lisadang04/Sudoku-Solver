# Sudoku-Solver
This program solves Sudoku puzzles using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) approach with backtracking and constraint propagation. Users can input a custom puzzle or generate a random one to solve. It displays the problem and solution if solvable; otherwise, it notifies the user if no solution exists.
